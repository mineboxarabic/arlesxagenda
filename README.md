# The propject of Yassin YOUNES

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Generals informations about the project
So in this project we needded to use new technologies to create an application that shows events in the city of Arles.

## Difficulties
- the first difficulty was to find an optimal way to read the big json file that was given to us.
- the second difficulty was to find a way to display the events on the map.
- the third difficulty was to find a good style for the application.

## Technologies used
- React
- React-leaflet
- React-router-dom
- React-useState
- React-useEffect
- React-useRef
- React-useContext

## How to use the application
- First you need to install the project on your computer.
- Then you need to install the dependencies with the command `npm install`. 
- Then you need to start the project with the command `npm start`, or you can build the project with the command `npm run build`.
- Then you can use the application.

## The pages of the application
<h3 style="color:red;">The search page</h3>
- The search page is the first page of the application and inside of it you can filter out the events by their date or by their category or by their location or by all of them, you will find all of the filtered events in the list below the search bar.
and it will show you the filter you used and of course you can change the filter and the list will change too.

<h3 style="color:red;">The month view page</h3>
- The month view page is the second page of the application and inside of it you can see all of the events in the month you choose and you can see the events in the list below the calendar and you can see the events on the map.



<h2> what are the selotions i used ?</h2>
- I started by looping through the data from the json and i put all the data i needed in an hashmap of objects.
- Then i created a context to store the data and the functions that i will use in the application.
- Then i created the search page and i used the context to get the data and the functions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
